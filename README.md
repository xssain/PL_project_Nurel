***
####Tic-Tac-Toe is our favorite game in childhood, it can be played anywhere and at any time, it is important to have only a pen and a piece of paper with you.
* Rules of the game
  1. The game is played on a grid that's 3 squares by 3 squares.
  2. You are X, your friend (or the computer in this case) is O. Players take turns putting their marks in empty squares.
  3. The first player to get 3 of her marks in a row (up, down, across, or diagonally) is the winner. 
  4. When all 9 squares are full, the game is over. If no player has 3 marks in a row, the game ends in a tie.
